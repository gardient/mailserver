# Mailserver
postfix-dovecot-roundqube-postfixadmin setup, backed by MariaDB, on Ubuntu 20.04

Mostly based on [Workaround.org's ISPMail tutorial for Debian Buster](https://workaround.org/ispmail/buster/)

# TODO
- [ ] Create base install script
  - [ ] can detect whether it's piped to bash or properly executed
  - [ ] can get any branch of the repo
  - [ ] can find latest tag based on GH release (and get that one)
